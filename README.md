# Dinolator-The dinosaur calculator

This is a simple calculator with a dinosaur theme, I aim for a didactic way to show  kids how units,tens and hundreds work together in basic math operations.
The main idea was to develop a calculator but to do things a little bit more interesting I added the dinosaur theme so now my proyect will have a more specific and clear goal and wont be another exercise calculator.  

Also this is a basic proyect i do to learn the basic tecnologies of the full-stack developer path .
I'll use html,css and javascript (maybe a little of jQuery there).
