# Dinolator-The dinosaur calculator

## General info

This is a simple calculator with a dinosaur theme, I aim for a didactic way to show  kids how units,tens and hundreds work together in basic math operations.

The main idea was to develop a calculator but to do things a little bit more interesting I added the dinosaur theme so now my proyect will have a more specific and clear goal and wont be an "exercise calculator".  

Also this is a basic proyect I do to learn the basic tecnologies of the full-stack developer path .

## Tecnologies used in this proyect:

* Html
* Css 
* JavaScript
